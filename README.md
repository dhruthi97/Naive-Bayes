# Naive-Bayes
Machine Learning Algorithm 
Naive-Bayes is the probabilistic machine learning model that is used for classification task.
This project represents how the model is trained with bayes theorem using iris dataset which is split into testing and training sets.
Naive-Bayes is mostly used mainly for solving real time systems.
